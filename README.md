### Continuous Integration Server
This repository contains an implementation of a Continuous Integration Server with features specified in assignment
\#2 in the course DD2480 Software Engineering Fundamentals. A brief description of the features; a push to the repo which
the CI server is connected to will trigger a build and execution of tests, the results from the build will then be sent
to the pusher as an email. The implementation is produced by group 22 and is based on the sample code skeleton provided in
[this repository](https://github.com/KTH-DD2480/smallest-java-ci). The core server implementation is available in the
file [src/main/java/ContinuousIntegrationServer.java](src/main/java/ContinuousIntegrationServer.java).

### Build Tool

#### Gradle
Gradle can be used to build and test the project. To do this, run `gradle build` in the root of the repo.

### Documentation
For documentation on the different methods and classes used, see code comments and especially javadoc comments. Javadoc was generated from commit 6298f23cc798500e18d5d0eae60edca5b81e7f97 (or possibly 9350876b9d7b90df83991aa63c5598099e7af14d) at 2020-02-10 and is hosted [here](https://dd2480-2021-group-22.github.io/dd2480-lab-2/) via GitHub pages.

### Commit message conventions
1. Each commit should reference an issue in the first line. To do this, use the "#" sign followed by the issue number. For example, a commit message might start with the line "fix #1".

2. When referencing a commit, exactly one of the following prefixes should be used:
    1. "feat": New feature for the user, not a new feature for build script.
    1. "fix": Bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script.
    1. "doc": Changes to the documentation.
    1. "style": Formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change.
    1. "refactor": Refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable.
    1. "config": Changes to config files.
    1. "test": Adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change.
    1. "chore": Updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change.


 ### Project structure
 This is the structure of the source code for the project. The illustration is taken from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41638654/java-project-folder-structure-in-intellij-idea).

### Usage
The CI server is located at [src/main/java/ContinuousIntegrationServer.java](src/main/java/ContinuousIntegrationServer.java).
The server must be hosted on a machine and can be set up for any public GitHub repository which has support for webhooks. In order
for the notification emails to work, the pusher must have a public GitHub email address. To set up the server for a repo, one runs
the server and then configures a webhook with the server address as "Payload URL", "application/json" as "Content type", the "Active"
checkbox ticked and for just the `push` event. Then, whenever a push is made, the CI server checks out the last commit and tries to
build and test the project using the gradle build task, and then sends the results to the pusher's email address.

### Database Structure
The database service used for this project was MySQL. A SQL file is found within the project that can be run using MySQL to setup the database
and the table `commit` with all of its column settings. The structure of the table works as following: 
| commitID VARCHAR(50) | buildDate VARCHAR(30) | buildResult BIT(1) | buildLogs MEDIUMTEXT |
|-- | -- |  -- |   -- | 

The primary key chosen for the table commit was commitID. This is because each commit hash is unique. 


### Dependencies
The code dependencies required are:
`mysql-connector-java` version 8.0.23: Main dependency for connecting to a MySQL database with java. 
`ch.vorburger.mariaDB4j` version 2.4.0: Used for testing queries on a database when one is not present. By passing the location to the SQL file found in this project,
mariaDB4j could be used to set up a local database for testing. 
In order to run this outside of the test environment, one would have to have MySQL (8.0.23) installed on their device, and run the database.sql file found in the root of this project.

### Grading Criteria

#### P1: Compilation
Compilation is implemented as part of the Gradle build task. The Gradle build task runs the Gradle assemble task, which compiles the project.

*Testing:* Compilation is unit-tested through two tests: One test ensures that a Gradle project with no syntax errors and no tests builds successfully. The other test ensures that the build fails for a Gradle project with a syntax error. These tests are found in the `GradleHandlerTest` class.

#### P2: Testing
Testing is also implemented as part of the Gradle build task. The Gradle build task runs the Gradle test task, which runs the JUnit tests of the project.

*Testing:* The testing functionality is unit-tested through two tests: One test asserts that a Gradle project which compiles but fails a test causes a failing build. The other test asserts that a Gradle project which compiles and has one passing test causes a successful build. These tests are found in the `GradleHandlerTest` class.

#### P3: Notifications (email)
The implementaion of mail utilizes javax.mail library to send email to the commit issuer.
The server information is stored and could also be set in `Mailserver.java` and is passed in as argument for `SendMail.java`
together with the objects `report` and `payload`. The `SendMail` class then formats the information and sends a notification to
the specified mail-address, notifying the user about build status, build date, build duration and build logs.

*Testing:* Lower-level testing is done through a local unit test in `SendMailTest` with fixed variable, sending a notification
to the senders own mailaddress. The generated MimeMessage is then checked that all correct fields corresponds to the objects Mailserver.java and Report.java.
Top-level testing is done through a integration test, where the notification of the builds are sent to the commit pusher.

### Contributions

 **Binxin Su:**
 - Implements P3 Notification #9 by adding `SendMail.java` class that sets properties for a outgoing SMTP server,
 generates a MimeMessage with correct format and sends it to a valid address (in integration test that is set to the commit issuer).
 - Adds `Mailserver.java` class that contains SMTP server information with corresponding getters and setters.
 - Implements unit tests for the generated MimeMessage, testing that fields of the MimeMessage corresponds to the inputs of the `Report` and
  `Payload` classes #9.
  - Adds getters and formatting of date, duration and logs in `Report.java`.

- Implementation of `GradleHandler` and corresponding tests.
- Initial implementation of `Payload` with parsing and corresponding tests.
- Implementation of the `RepoSnapshot` class with code for cloning and checking out the repo, as well as corresponding tests.
- Helped refactor `MysqlDatabase` and corresponding tests to support testing with no dependencies on MySQL.
- Helped with integration of cloning, building and email tasks and writing the integration test ensuring all of these work together.
